Entries in this list can only be removed if the object's deletionTimestamp is not null. The processing and removal of finalizers can happen in any sequence. No order is enforced as it may block the finalizers. Finalizers is a shared field that can be reordered by any actor with authority. If the finalizer list is processed in order, this could result in a scenario where the component in charge of the list's first finalizer is waiting for a signal (generated by a field value, an external system, or another) produced by a component in charge of the list's later finalizer.

The name returned to the client will differ from the name passed if this field is used. A unique suffix will be added to this value as well. The supplied value must adhere to the same validation guidelines as the Name field and may be reduced by the suffix length necessary to ensure that it is unique on the server. The server will NOT return a 409 if this field is supplied and the created name already exists; instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout, indicating that a unique name could not be found in the allotted time and the client should try again later.
